*«If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.» (Matthew 5:29-30)*

### Android Pornography DNS filter:
- An open source app which controls the information flow in and out of an Android phone, blocks ponography, evil and toxic websites in an unsophisticated way.

- How it works: It blocks known pornographic domains. Popular websites containing pornographic material aren't spared, these include: Twitter, Reddit, Instagram (focus on superficial and shallow content) and Wikipedia images. Safe search is enforced on Google while all other search engines are blocked.

- Technical note: It is a **DNS** based filter, so it is was not designed to work as a firewall.

### Install and enable [personalDNSfilter](https://github.com/ingozenz/personaldnsfilter) app on Android:
First download the app and install it:

<a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/dnsfilter.android/" target="_blank">

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pornography-protection/filter-android/main/b

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pornography-protection/filter-android/main/c
```

<img src="snapshots/004.png" alt="Snapshot 4" width="200" />

5. Go back to the main menu, click **'Advanced settings'**, then **'Configure additional hosts'**:

6. Type the following line at the end, don't forget the `>` at the beginning:

`>www.google.com 216.239.38.120`

<img src="snapshots/007.png" alt="Snapshot 7" width="200" />

7. Finally go back (click **'Advanced settings'**) then click **'RESTART'**:

<img src="snapshots/005.png" alt="Snapshot 5" width="200" />

You will now have blocked pornographic domains and enforced Google safe search.
