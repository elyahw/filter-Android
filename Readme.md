*«If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.» (Matthew 5:29-30)*

### Android Pornography DNS filter:
- Control the information flow in and out of your phone, block ponography, evil and toxic websites. Time is holy, don't waste it.

- Caution: In addition to pornographic domains, this app will additionally block: Twitter (due to pornography), Instagram (poisonous to the spirit due to superficial contents), wikipedia images and known search engines except Google (where safe search is enforced).
